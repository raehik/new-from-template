pyplater-tutorial.md
Heya! This is a tutorial file for Pyplater, intended for seeing how variable and
command substitution works -- but it's also a template file itself! Dogfooding
to the max!

TODO use verbose things everywhere

%{nope}% <-- Here I tried to print a variable that doesn't exist.
%{HOME}% <-- This is the value of your $HOME environment variable!
%{!1}% <-- That's the first argument you sent me -- if you didn't send me one,
Pyplater should fail!

1st argument once verbose: %{\1}% and again but non-verbose: %{1}% (requires
Pyplater to know position in the current line of the match it's replacing)

3 * argument 1 on the same line: %{1}% %{1}% %{1}%
